Anuj spoke about how learning and interacting with Virat helped his game! 👊
Anuj keeping looks good at ipl2023.. needed some improvement..
Batting he need to play with full intent.. as a finisher he tried his best.. as a top order failed..
Sehwag said "Everybody will look to win the World Cup for Virat Kohli, he always gives more than 100% for the team".
Virat is stress buster for all...
One of the finest pacers to grace our game! 🎳
The King casually slaying off the field!
Doubling Down 💯💯
A look back at some of King Kohli's finest tons along his 12-year journey in Test cricket, that were converted into double hundreds! 👑

Can't wait anymore.
#rcbvslsg krva do please bhagwan. Are you still wondering 🤔 which are two ✌️ next team's to play for playoffs out of top 4️⃣
JioCinema viewership peaked at 2.2cr tonight - 2nd highest this season after 2.4cr (RCB Vs CSK). King Kohli rules the league!
Dissolve this RCB management. Give the team to fans. We will build it. If you want funds, we will raise.
Rcb is not a sports franchise, it's a marketing agency with @imVkohli being a brand face. Said before the start of the IPL during the unbox event, that they are more focused on glitter than the results
True RCB fan, need quality Indian players to win IPL. Only Kholi and Siraj were the only 2 players who were excellent.  Rawat and Vyshak were decent, apart from these 4 everyone else were below average. You need 10-13 in form players to win IPL.
What he said is right. Unless the Indian players perform, an #IPL team can never win the Tournament.Just top 3 batsman can never win a Trophy. Its a team game. RCB management has never made any effort to spend money to get good Indian players, apart from Kohli.
Next time buy Rohit Sharma🤣 as capitan and give him 2 years time, he will bring 1 IPL trophy to RCB
Pathetic management…. Whatever he said is absolute true 🥹
Utilization of Bracewell after 10 over was horrible decision.This match was given easily to GT, (MI) indirectly.
Cheering for the mighty #RCB as they take on their rivals today! Let's see them hit it out of the park and secure a victory. Go RCB! 🏏🔥 #PlayBold #IPL2023"

"Captain Virat Kohli leading from the front with his unmatched passion and skills. It's always a treat to watch him don the RCB jersey. #KingKohli #RCB #IPL"
"AB de Villiers showing us why he's known as 'Mr. 360' with his extraordinary shots and game-changing innings. Truly a force to be reckoned with! #ABDevilliers #RCB"
"The young and talented Devdutt Padikkal proving his mettle with every match. He's definitely one to watch out for in the RCB squad. 🌟 #Padikkal #RCB #IPL"
